There are numerous programming languages used in web development, each with its own set of features 
and purposes. Below is a comprehensive list of popular web development programming languages: 
 
1. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): Used for creating the structure and content of web pages. 
 
2. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): Used for styling and designing the visual presentation of web pages. 
 
3. JavaScript: A versatile scripting language used for adding interactivity, dynamic content, and behavior t
o web pages. 
 
4. PHP: A server-side scripting language commonly used for developing dynamic websites and web appli
cations. 
 
5. Python: A high-level, versatile programming language used for web development, offering frameworks l
ike Django and Flask. 
 
6. Ruby: A user-friendly language known for its simplicity, often used with the Ruby on Rails framework fo
r web development. 
 
7. Java: A widely-used programming language with a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, such as
Spring and JavaServer Pages (JSP), for building enterprise-level web applications. 
 
8. C#: Developed by Microsoft, C# is used for building web applications on the .NET framework, with fram
eworks like ASP.NET. 
 
9. TypeScript: A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and enhanced tooling capabilities, making i
t a popular choice for larger-scale web applications. 
 
10. Go (Golang): A language developed by Google, known for its simplicity, efficiency, and strong support
for concurrency, making it suitable for building web services and APIs. 
 
11. Swift: Apple’s programming language primarily used for iOS app development, but it can also be used
for web development with frameworks like Vapor. 
 
12. Rust: A systems programming language focused on safety, speed, and concurrency. It can be used fo
